DiffuseR is a small drawing program that allows you to paint some reaction diffusion style artwork. 
It will allow for:
- layers??? (why if these are flat images?)
    - enable and disable layers
    - reorder layers
    - delete / add layers
- brushes
    - size
    - colors
    - falloff settings
    - stamps
    - painting wobble (noise offset from mouse position);
    - smooth brush strokes
    - shift to keep straight
- paintbucket
- eyedropper
- symmetry 
    - axis based
    - custom axis
    - radial
    - symmetry stacking
    - formula based
- undo and redo
- export image
- export layers
- save and load
- theme
- larger canvases for large hi res images
- draw vertices and then render them as pixel perfect curves

CODE STYLE:
Diffuser is written in java for Windows (maybe mac). 
It must be commented heavily as its my first java application.


WHAT DOES THE UI ACTUALY NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO?
- Support images
- Highlight, click, press
- Object hierarchy (for disabling and enabling interfaces
- rendering to separate graphics objetcs
- Copy paste
- movement, lerping easing out
- dragging
- constrain
- sliders
- color picking and HSB wheel
- Tooltip
- input actions

-idea to have user create shape based guide lines that the cursor will snap to allowing the
  user to draw lines that are crisp and mathematically based.
    -create the shape and move its position around and its size and rotation
    -when close enough to the bounds of the spape (the line) snap the cursor

- have animation options like rotation and scaling (sine based, nothing complex)
- render to a gif or video?


WHAT IS DOESNT NEED TO DO
- keep it fucking simple dummy
